Hi all, 

After learning React for slightly more than a week, i tried to create a simple e-commerce App!

I implemented the following: 
1) React Basics (use of States, Props, Components)
2) Redux (configureStore, reducers, slices, useSelectors)
3) Routers (RouterProvider, createBrowserRouter, Route, createRoutesFromElements)
4) Fetch data from an API

In the e-commerce App, you can:
1) View the store and select what you want to add to the cart
2) Filter the store items by category
3) Currency filter to change between 3 different types of currency
4) Adjust your cart further by adjusting quantity
5) Submitting the cart to confirm your purchase

Do give me your feedback if you happen to see my code!

Thanks!
